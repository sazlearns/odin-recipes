    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This no-churn blackberry ice cream is without a doubt one of my all-time favorite ways to enjoy fresh
        blackberries in
        season.</p>

    <p>The texture is absolutely perfect - you’ll have no idea you didn’t use a machine, and the fresh
        blackberries
        you’ll smash in at the end takes it from great to mind-blowing.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds fresh blackberries, rinsed and drained, divided</li>
        <li>1/3 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Add 1 1/2 pounds of the blackberries (about 5 cups), sugar, and lemon juice to a saucepan and bring to a
                simmer over
                medium heat.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Use a potato masher to crush berries, and continue to simmer until mixture thickens and reduces by half,
                about 20
                minutes. Heat can be turned up to reduce faster, but will require more careful watching to be sure
                blackberries do not
                scorch.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Strain blackberry mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl, being sure to get every drop of
                juice;
                discard fiber
                and seeds. Stir sweetened condensed milk and vanilla into the bowl; refrigerate mixture until completely
                cold, about 1
                hour.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Beat cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until medium-stiff peaks form. Add
                half
                the whipped
                cream to chilled blackberry mixture; fold in with a whisk until almost all the cream is incorporated.
                Add
                remaining
                whipped cream; use a spatula to gently fold in. Pour mixture into a container, cover, and freeze until
                solid, at least 4
                hours and up to overnight.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>To serve, add as many of the fresh berries you want to the top, and use an ice cream scoop to mix and
                smash
                them into the ice cream as you scoop. Add a few remaining berries on top of each serving.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
